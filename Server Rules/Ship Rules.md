Safe Parking is at the Spaceport near Spawn

Vehicles left parking or flying outside the spaceport anywhere within 100 chunks of spawn are liable to be impounded.  
A fee will be required to recover your vehicle if this happens.  
(One chunk is a single 16x16-block space from bedrock to the world ceiling)

Parking over planets leaves you liable to looting by others!  
Log off with your ship parked at your base or at the spaceport to assure safety!

No weapons fire or offensive magic anywhere near hyperspace gates or satellites! (This means over Planets)  
Offenders will be insta-blapped and their ship or gear will not be compensated!
