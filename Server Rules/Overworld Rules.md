Players may use all the available infrastructure on the overworld at their leisure.

No Chunk claims will be given for the overworld.  
If you wish to provide a permanent structure for use by other players on the overworld:  
First, build your design on a creative, superflat world (if no open plot is available).   
Then, send your map file to an admin, along with explicit info on where you want this build to go (XYZ coords are best).  
If approved, you will be given all the materials you require for your build, and once finished, and admin will chunk-claim it for you.

Stealing from other players on the overworld is fine.  
Hitting them with your sword is not.  
Secure your loot and lock your doors if you insist on staying in a place you cannot safely live in (remember, people can just mine out your walls in the overworld).

Any player who is reported to intentionally kill another while on the overworld will be temporarily banned without question.  
Yes, we can check this and prove if someone is lying or not.

'Alternate' forms of PvP ARE allowed on the overworld.  
This includes:  
-Taglock collection  
-Trapped plants  
-Any Base Defense (turrets, golems, etc.)  
-Void, Warp, or Taint related shenanigans  
-Rift shenanigans


No griefing senselessly. If you blow a million holes in the world for no good reason, we're just going to reload a backup.  
Carnage is fine: Where it Belongs.
