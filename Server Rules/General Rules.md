No intentionally exploiting broken mechanics as a means to gain advantage over others.  
If you find an issue: report it.  
Reporting any issues will gain you far more benefits than exploiting them.

No PvP in designated safe zones  
(Space over Planets, overworld, end during events, twilight)  
This is a bannable offense if caught being broken and must be enforced on an individual level until the proper server mods can be installed and configured.

No Base Raiding in Dedicated Build Worlds  
(Planet J7, Planet O2, Planet RA)  
'Base Raiding' includes ANY destructive entry method used as a means to gain access to another players loot.  
Non-destructive entry methods are mandatory on these worlds.  
This rule must be enforced on a personal level to ensure the enjoyment of everyone on the server.  
Players reported and confirmed to have raided an established colony on any of the listed planets are liable to be banned.

No excessive Mystcraft Ages.  
Notify an admin to mark any unused Ages for deletion.  
This can become a serious problem for server stability.  
If too many ages are written and not enough are being used, the ability to write new ages may be temporarily or permanently disabled for players.  
The same applies to RFTools Dimensions and Compact Machines.

Turn off your redstone machines when you log off the server (NOT Thermal machines, most-anything generating RF can stay on).  
Normal Redstone ticks can cause server lag that compounds over time if not kept under control.  
This is a 'feature' of older versions that cannot be fully fixed.  

No quarries on the Overworld.  
If you tear a scar in the world, we will revert it to a backup and kick you.

Disable ALL quarries and automation when offline.  
This includes mining robots and farming golems, as well as some things that may not be on this list (new objects will be added here if discovered to be a problem)

Keep chunkloaders to a minimum.  
Chunkloaders include: poppet shelves, robots, RFTools chunkloader, Warpdrive chunkloader.  
There is no current set limit, but if it becomes a problem there will be.  
At most 5 chunkloaders per person seems reasonable.

Blockswapping is a mechanic on our server.  
Use it, but do not abuse it.  
If you fall under the bedrock on the overworld, you'll fall into the Nether.  
If you use block-swapping to get inside of somewhere you obviously shouldn't be, you may be banned.  
The ceiling of the Nether may be used to build your machines, but keep in mind that this is an open-pvp world!  
If you build a machine in the Nether that you wish to be protected and available for all players to use, contact an admin and it may be chunk claimed or surrounded in bedrock (or both).
