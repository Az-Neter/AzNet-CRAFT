Come join us on a New Adventure through some of the best Old Content modded MC has to offer!  
On our server you can do things such as:  
-Fly a spaceship  
-Conquer Territory  
-Gamble  
-Do Drugs  
-Go Insane  
-Rip Holes in Reality  
...and Much Much More!!!  

The Primary focus of our server in on Adventuring and Exploration, with a secondary focus on Base Building and PvP.

Our Overworld is PvP-Free, so your early game should have no worry of other players slowing down your progress, as long as you're careful to secure your loot before logging off.  
We have a lot of Public Infrastructure on the Overworld, which everyone can use, and much more future work is planned.

We have dozens of dimensions to visit, some of which can only be accessed by flying a custom multiblock spaceship that you build, traveling via Space to discover a new planet to explore.  
Other dimensions have more obscure or unique means of access.

We have two primary 'Class' paths: Magic, and Tech.  
Tech is Exclusively Thermal- and RF-Based, while Magic has various options fitting each playstyle and type of magic.  
Anything that can be done with one Class is possible with the other, using different means.

Our Chunk-Claiming System is PvP-Based: you must actively defend your territory once claimed, as well as maintain it with payment via regular upkeep.  
Note: No Chunk Claims are given out on the Overworld; You can only set up a permanent base in other dimensions (with some restrictions).

Some of our rules require upkeep on an individual level: that means that you must know the rules and then CHOOSE to follow them, knowing that you benefit everyone by doing so.  
We're very serious about maintining our server, and anyone found breaking rules will be subject to a very fast banning.  
Our rules are as they are to ensure the most fun for everyone, but it only takes one bad person to ruin a good system.  
Our full Rules list can be found included in our modpack.
