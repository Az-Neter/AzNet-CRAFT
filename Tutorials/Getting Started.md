On our server, we have two different paths you could take for progression, as well as numerous cross-path interactions between them;
Magic, and Tech.

The Magic mods include things like Thaumcraft, Botania, Blood Magic, and addons for each of them.  
Almost every magic mod has a book included that will walk you through their progressions.  
Most of the books are crafted via some means as shown in NEI.  
The Thaumonomicon from Thaumcraft is made by using a magic wand on a bookshelf.   
All books will be available from the Spawn Libary on the Overworld (Planet 0M)  
(Ask an admin if you need something that's missing)

The Tech mods include things like Thermal Foundation, WarpDrive, OpenComputers, and addons for each.  
Every machine on our server runs off or produces RF (Redstone Flux).   
Some tech mods come with books, such as OpenComputers, but many others don't; you will be relying on NEI or online wikis for most recipes and progressions.  
All programs are written in Lua.   
In the future, a list of links for each Api available will be provided.

Tech mods and Magic mods are nearly identical in what they can accomplish for you:  
You can double or triple resources, auto-mine, set up base defense and get around faster.  
The only difference comes down to how it looks and ultimately how it's achieved via in-game mechanics.  
Tech obviously relies on leveraging highly-customizable machinery in order to achieve your ends, and magic relies on utilizing nature and the energy it provides for the same ends.  
You can also turn magic into technology, and vice-versa.

For starting in Magic, your best option is to read the Thaumonomicon or the Lexica Botania in order to begin progression. You could also read some of the books on Druidry or Witchcraft if desired.  
For starting the Tech path, you must first build a machine capable of generating RF and then decide how you will put that energy to use. The easiest engine to build is the Forestry Clockwork Dynamo.

Before getting too entrenched in mod progression, you will want to get the most basic Vanilla progressions out of the way.  
You should be in at least Iron armor, ideally, with a crafting table, anvil, and access to the Nether available to you.  
You will also want your food supply established and a small amount of voxels saved up in case you need them.  

Voxels are acquired by trading your items with Villager Creepers or as drops from killing mobs, and they can be traded to The Administrator creeper for their item variants that can be traded between players as currency.  

Once you have your basic needs and mod progressions started, you will want to find somewhere to set up a permanent base in which you can chunk claim (ie. Anywhere Not on the Overworld).  
It's recommended that you take over existing worldgen structures for this; it will save you significant time building your initial base framework and allow you more room and a bigger potential for future expansion.  
You want to Build Big.   
If you plan to use a lot of mods, you will find yourself quickly running out of space if you don't compensate your build for it early on.  
There are dozens, if not hundreds of unique, pregenerated structures that you can claim as your own, in nearly every dimension.  

Once you have you base location chosen, contact an admin to chunk claim it, and then begin expanding and defending your territory.  
90% of the fun you will have here is when another player comes to steal your loot, and you kick them out on their sorry asses, instead stealing their kit for trying.  

Maintain your base, expand, defend, and if desired, go out there and take what you want from those who are available to be taken from (in good fun and faith and with honor, of course!)
